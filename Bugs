Bugs:
1. 
- Menu Button interfering with button press on levels where ball's layout is IEObjectLayaoutTopLeft
- Solution: Remove button and call menu by double tap gesture recognizer/touch counter

To Do:
1.
- Write levels 80 - 85
	- These levels will use ghost and immunity powerups

2.
- Create portal functionality
	- Add functionality to IEBounceLevelController
	- Add to MainScene implementation
	- Create remaining levels 85 - 100 using all used powerups as well as portals.

3.
- Add Snap feature to line drawing. Feature includes:
	- Snapping to straight angles (0, 90, 180, 270 degree angles)
	- Snapping to angles previously drawn in the current game. (Ex. player draws 32 degree angle, future lines will snap to 32 degrees/ 32+180 degrees)
	- Snapping to already drawn points if the distance is short.

4.
- Add leaderboard to app.
	- Create authentication from App Delegate
	- Give functionality to menu. If the user is not authenticated the game center view controller will be saved and used if the leaderboard button is pressed
	- Add leaderboard to app profile with desired settings. Leaderboard will track number of stars

5.
- Add ad functionality as interstitials.

6.
- Add following in app purchases.
